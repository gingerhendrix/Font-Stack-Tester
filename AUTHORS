Font Stack Tester was created and developed by Robert Lee-Cann (leeky). Thanks to the
wonderful community at GitHub.com for their feedback and contributions, including:

* Stefan MÃ¼ssig who untangled my concept code and wrote bookmarklet.js out of it.
* Chris Hess who proved through an iframe/php that it was useful for testing live web sites.
